# Grib Decoder C++

This repository was created as a working representation of a decoder based on bitwise shifting in C++.  
It is also designed for future expansion due to the modularity of the code.  
The decoder is based on the following documentation: [https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/)

The table below represents the elements covered by this decoder.
